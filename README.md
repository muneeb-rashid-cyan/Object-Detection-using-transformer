# Object-Detection-using-transformer


### Object Detection using Transformer is a project that utilizes the power of Transformer-based models to detect objects in images. The project includes the implementation of the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model, which is a state-of-the-art object detection model that replaces the traditional sliding window approach with a set prediction problem, thereby simplifying the detection pipeline.
